# Stock Price Prediction Model

## Introduction:
(Note: This project was created as a submission for my college's 24-hour Hackathon. The project in its entirety was built and tested within the given time duration.)

This was my attempt at creating a Stock Price Prediction model, which takes a recent set of data for a specific company and attempts to predict future prices (both the range of the data and how far in the future the prediction is user-defined).

Through this project, I learned the basics of Machine Learning and the tools used to create such models. I also learned how to use Flask and the basics of web application development.

## Workings:
Please run the ```Test_Flask.py``` file using a Python interpreter. You can do this by opening a terminal, navigating to the directory containing the ```Test_Flask.py``` file, and running the following command:
```
python Test_Flask.py
```
The presentation is also included in the repository.

Note: The company-name input takes in the Ticker symbol of the company. For example, to get data for Google, you would enter "GOOG". To get data for Apple, you would enter "AAPL". To get data for Nike, you would enter "NKE". To get data for Crude Oil May, you would enter "CL=F"
